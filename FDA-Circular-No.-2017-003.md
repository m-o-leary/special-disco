## I. BACKGROUND

Republic Act (RA) No, 3720 (Food, Drugs and Devices and Cosmetics Act), as amended by RA No. 9711 (Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009) mandates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate establishments engaged in health products to ensure consumer safety, welfare protection, and fair trade practice.

On 25 February 2014, FDA Memorandum Circular No. 2014-005, Updated List of Medical Devices required to be registered prior to sale, distribution and use was issued so as to provide the initial list of medical devices and in-vitro diagnostic medical devices that are required for mandatory registration. Industries which manufacture, import and distribute medical devices that are registrable are required to secure LTO as Medical Device Manufacturer, Importer and/or Distributor. Those industries which manufacture, import and distribute medical devices that are not registrable are exempted from securing the LTO.

However, on 15 February 2016, Administrative Order No. 2016-0003, Guidelines on the Unified Licensing Requirements and Procedures of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was issued requiring all establishments to secure LTO whether the medical devices to be manufactured, imported and distributed-are registrable or not registrable.

## II. SCOPE AND PURPOSE

This circular clarifies the provisions of Administrative Order No. 2016-0003 to strictly implement the mandatory requirement to secure LTO.
